# Xcdat: xor-compressed double-array trie

Xcdat is a C++ library that implements static compressed string dictionaries based on an improved double-array trie.

The double array is known as the fastest trie representation and has been used in many trie libraries. On the other hand, it has a space efficiency problem because of a pointer-based data structure. Xcdat solves the problem using the XOR-compressed double-array methods described in the following article.

Xcdat can implement trie dictionaries in smaller space compared to the other double-array libraries. In addition, the lookup speed is relatively fast in compressed data structures from the double-array advantage.
